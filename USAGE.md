# How to get started
## Requirements
```
Python 3.8 or higher
```

To get started you just have to execute the program and you will see two folders get created

- built
- src

`src` is the location where you place your code the file format is .spy

After you finish your .spy files inside of src just run the StaticPy program again and it will attempt to build your code and tell you of any errors.

After this is complete you will see your .py files inside of built that you can execute normally
